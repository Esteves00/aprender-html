            <p>The Hygge lifestyle can be for anyone and everyone—you just have to prioritize comfort. Your house should feel like a home. Not cold and detached. When you extend your comfort to the outdoors, you build a space that offers several benefits and makes you feel right at home on your property.</p>

            <h2>What is Hygge?</h2>
            <p>Hygge is a Danish word pronounced “Hyoogah.” It is a lifestyle that embraces coziness and the calm of life. 
                You want to feel relatable in your own home, and following a Hygge lifestyle will let you relax—no more worrying
                 about what other people may think about you or your home. You want your home welcoming and inviting, 
                 not necessarily look perfect on social media. To live a Hygge lifestyle, you need to do is prioritize 
                 human connection over gadgets or any other distractions. Having a comfortable home is the best way to focus on 
                 the things you love while avoiding the things that don’t make energy. Focus on soft things that bring you comfort, 
                 and decorate every inch of your house with purpose—including your backyard.</p>
